# School_District_Analysis
This repository is created in order to do an Analysis for the school district for Maria
## Project Overview
Maria is the Chief Data Scientist for the District. She assists the School Board with strategic decision and in helping them in making and direction by providing them insight on the funding provided to schools within the District while keeping in the mind the results of standardised testing.
She has been asked to analyse the data collected for 15 different schools within the district and I will be assisting her on this project.
We conducted an anlysis on the funding and the proficiency levels achieved by the 15 schools and we will call this as <b>'Stage A'</b> of the Project. This is because at the very last minute we received news that the math & reading scores for Grade 9 at Thomas High School showed evidence of possible 'academic dishonesty'. Maria made a decision to replace the math and reading scores with NaN for Thomas High School while keeping the rest of the data intact. The results of the analysis keeping this new reality will be referred to as <b>'Analysis B'</b> .
## Purpose of the Analysis
As a consequence of this new development, the purpose of this analysis is to also present the changes on the overall results as well the results for Thoams High School between the Analysis that was conducted at these teo stages.
